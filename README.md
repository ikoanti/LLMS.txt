# llms.txt

The `llms.txt` initiative is an open, community-driven effort that empowers website owners to declare their preferences regarding access by Large Language Models (LLMs), similar to how `robots.txt` governs access by search engine crawlers.

## What is llms.txt?

`llms.txt` is a plaintext file placed at the root of your domain (e.g., `https://example.com/llms.txt`). It provides a standardized way to list LLM providers and express whether or not they are permitted to access and use your content for training, fine-tuning, or inference purposes.

This approach promotes transparency, control, and respect for content rights in the age of AI-powered tools and platforms.

## Why Use llms.txt?

- **Transparency** – Make your content usage policy clear to AI crawlers.
- **Control** – Decide which LLMs may or may not use your content.
- **Standardization** – Join a growing number of publishers in adopting a common method to communicate with LLMs.
